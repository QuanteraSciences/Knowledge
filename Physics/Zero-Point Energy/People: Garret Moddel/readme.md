Experiments show that there is a real possibility that zero-point energy can be harvested to produce electrical power. Zero-point energy is the result of quantum fluctuations in materials and in the vacuum itself. 

This video describes how the energy is harvested, the practical and scientific implications of this, and what the reaction of the scientific community has been so far.
